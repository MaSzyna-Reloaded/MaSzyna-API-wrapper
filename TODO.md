## Cabins

* `VirtualCabin` for cabs without a hi-fi model (MMD `cabNmodel: none` or missing, e.g. su46
  `cab0definition:`) - built only when the cab exists, purely for input actions and command
  translation (no geometry, no MMD instrument widgets). The original keeps such a cab enterable
  and shows the low-poly interior instead (`Train.cpp:8692`, `DynObj.cpp:1214`). Hook point:
  `DynamicTrainCabin` currently builds an empty cabin with `has_cab_model = false`.
* Cabin keyboard input per control, not per widget - today every `CabinButton`/`CabinSwitch`/
  `CabinKnob` handles its own `action*` in `_input`/`_process`, so a label repeated in one cab
  (EP07 cab0 has two `cablight_sw:`) got the key once per widget and toggled itself back. The
  original maps a key to one command changing one state (`Cabine[].bLight`, `Train.cpp:10237`),
  the gauges only display it. Move key handling to `CabinSystem`/`LegacyCabinLogicDelegate`
  (once per `control_id`), widgets only display; then drop the workaround in
  `MmdCabinInstancer.build_into()` clearing `action*` on repeated labels.
