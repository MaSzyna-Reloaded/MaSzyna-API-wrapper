## Baseline for the #184 architecture rework: what the vehicle state costs today, so that every
## later stage has a number to be judged against instead of a claim.
##
## It asserts correctness only and PRINTS the timings. A time assertion in CI is a flake - the
## numbers are for a human comparing two runs of the same machine.
##
## Measure on `make compile-profiling`. `compile-debug` builds the vendored Mover.cpp at -O0,
## which makes the physics several times slower than a shipped build and sends any comparison
## after the wrong subsystem (TODO.md, "Physics performance").
##
## The vehicle is the fixture FIZ (Brake/BuffCoupl/Cntrl/Dimensions/Doors/Param/Wheels, plus the
## Horns the instancer always attaches) with an electric engine, lighting and a spring brake
## added the way a hand-authored scene adds them. That is eight parts, not the fourteen a real
## locomotive carries,
## so the absolute key count is lower than a scenery's - what matters is that it is the same
## vehicle on both sides of a change.
##
## The vehicles stand on a real fixture track on purpose: one without a track computes a NaN
## transform, and `NaN > culling_distance` is false, so it is never culled and the bench would
## measure a path the game does not take (FINDINGS.md, 2026-09-22).
