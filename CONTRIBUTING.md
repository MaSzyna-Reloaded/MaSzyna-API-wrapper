# Contributing

## Request for changes/ Pull Requests
You first need to create a fork of this repository to commit your changes to it. Methods to fork a repository can be found in the [GitHub Documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/quickstart/fork-a-repo).

## Choose a base branch
Before starting development, you need to know which branch to base your modifications/additions on. When in doubt, use `main`.

| Type of change                | Branch prefix | Branches              |
| :------------------           |:---------:| ---------------------:|
| Development work              | `dev`     | `main`                |
| Bug fixes                     | `fix`     | `main`                |
| New features                  | `feature` | `main`                |

```sh
# Switch to the desired branch
git switch main

# Pull down any upstream changes
git pull

# Create a new branch to work on
git switch --create [prefix]/[feature-or-fix-name]
```

BRanch prefixes look as following:


Commit your changes, then push the branch to your fork with `git push -u fork` and open a pull request on the base repository.
