## Skydome's volumetric fog volume is 8 m deep by day and 3 m by night. The volume is measured from
## the camera, so a light shaft can only be seen while its lamp is inside it - at 3 m, never. This
## stretches the volume; the density is divided by the same factor, which leaves the optical depth
## (extinction per metre times length) - and so the look of the fog - unchanged. At 24 that is 72 m
## by night and 192 m by day. Raising it further spreads the same froxel depth slices over more
## metres, which softens the fog near the camera, and shafts still stop where the light's shadow
## does (E3DRenderingServer.SCENERY_LIGHT_SHADOW_FADE_DISTANCE) - the two have to be raised together.

## How the fog builds up with the distance z from the camera: opacity = fog_density *

## fog_density itself is scaled. The original's fog is 1 - exp(-(z / range)^2) (apply_fog.glsl:16);
## an exponent of 1.5 with the fog complete at 1.5 of that range starts as slowly as it does
## (19/54/100% against 22/63/90% at 0.5/1/1.5 of the range) - hence the two defaults.

## 1 - evenly, above 1 - clear near the camera and thickening further away, below 1 - thick right

## How fast the fog right in front of the camera (the volumetric layer) dies out once fog_distance

## scenery that declares a fog of kilometres (stary_jawor_noc asks for 2-4 km, which becomes a
## fog_distance of 2250-4500 m) drives the falloff to 0.01-0.04 and leaves the air by the camera
## with no haze at all - and a street lamp with nothing to scatter in casts no visible shaft. Real
## night air is never that clean, so the haze thins towards this share instead of towards nothing.
