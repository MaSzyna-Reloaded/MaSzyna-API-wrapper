# MaSzyna-API-wrapper
## About the project
This C++ GDExtension for Godot Engine offers a simplified interface to the MaSzyna train simulator API. Tailored for the MaSzyna Reloaded project, it enables developers to construct train components using Godot's Node-based system, providing a visual and intuitive approach to train creation and management. Key features include:

- Custom Node-based Classes: Create train elements using our premade and integrated classes based on Godot's familiar Node system.
- Parameter Customization: Fine-tune train parameters directly within the Godot editor.
- Simplified Integration: Seamlessly integrate the MaSzyna simulator physics into your Godot projects.
- Enhanced Debugging: Streamline the debugging process for your train simulations.
### Setup
1. Install Python 3
2. Install scons using `pip install scons`
